# AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal Utility

-----------------------------------------------------------------
## Overview 

AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal Utility can be used to remove MMA extension/agent from Azure Virtual Machine (VMs), Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) and Azure Arc Servers across subscriptions. Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) [will be retired on 31 August 2024](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/were-retiring-the-log-analytics-agent-in-azure-monitor-on-31-august-2024/) and users need to migrate to Azure Monitor Agent (AMA). If you have already migrated all of your mentioned resources to start using AMA for monitoring, it is recommended to remove MMA agent to avoid duplication of logs.

AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal Utility can help to remove MMA extension from Azure Virtual Machine (VMs), Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) and Azure Arc Servers which already have AMA extension present, in bulk/at tenant scale in centralized manner instead of doing it per resource manually.

## How does it work?

AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal Utility works in two phases:
1. Discovery Phase
2. Removal Phase

**1- Discovery Phase**

In this phase, it will prepare the inventory of all VM(s), VMSS(s), Azure Arc Servers and their extensions to identify, which resources have both MMA and AMA or only MMA agents installed. In next phase (i.e., 'Removal Phase'), users can choose to remove MMA extension from the resources having either both MMA and AMA agents or just MMA agent. 

It is recommended to avoid creating new VMs, VMSS and Azure Arc Servers with MMA extension or installing MMA extension on existing Azure resources after AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal utility starts processing. For this you can assign Azure policy with 'Deny' effect on your subscriptions before running this utility. Guidance for same is available [here](./MMAAgentDenyPolicyInstructions.md).

**2- Removal Phase**

Resources having both MMA and AMA agents are picked up in this phase for removal of MMA extensions. Users have the option to disable this phase, and enable/run it after validating the inventory of these resources list prepared in the Discovery phase.
Users also have the option to run this phase on resources which have just MMA agents (But recommended approach is to first migrate all dependencies to AMA agent and then remove MMA agent).

## Installation

For the single-tenant setup, please refer [here](./SingleTenantSetupInstallation.md) and for the multi-tenant setup, please refer [here](./MultiTenantSetupInstallation.md), to install and configure AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal utility.

## Schedule or Trigger

Once the installation is completed, users can choose to either run the 'Discovery phase' immediately or schedule it to run after specific time interval.

Similarly once 'Discovery phase' is completed, users can choose to either trigger 'Removal phase' immediately or schedule it to run after specific time interval.

### Schedule or Trigger Discovery phase
Discovery phase is disabled by default, users need to enable and schedule it using the command **Update-AzTSMMARemovalUtilityDiscoveryTrigger**.


> **Note:** Please validate the prerequisites [here](./Prerequisites.md). You can download the deployment package zip from [here](https://github.com/azsk/AzTS-docs/raw/main/TemplateFiles/AzTSMMARemovalUtilityDeploymentFiles.zip) and before extracting the zip file, right click on the zip file --> click on 'Properties' --> Under the General tab in the dialog box, select the 'Unblock' checkbox --> Click on 'OK' button. Extract the zip file and use **MMARemovalUtilitySetup.ps1** present in this package to run the commands mentioned in below section.

## FAQs

### **1. At what scope(s) can the AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal utility run?** 
The AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal utility is highly flexible and configurable. It allows you to choose the desired scope(s) where you want to run the utility. You can configure it to operate at selected subscription scopes, specific management group scopes, the entire tenant, or even across multiple tenants.

### **2. What permissions does the AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal utility require?** 
To operate effectively, the AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal utility creates a remediation identity. The specific permissions required for this identity depend on the scope and context. In the case of a single tenant, a user-assigned managed identity with the 'Reader', 'Virtual Machine Contributor' and 'Azure Arc ScVmm VM Contributor' roles is used. For multi-tenant scopes, an Azure AD App/SPN is employed. It is essential to grant the appropriate permissions to this identity at the configured scopes for successful execution.

### **3. After MMA agents have been removed from all VM(s), VMSS(s) and Azure Arc Servers should I clean up the setup?**
Once all MMA agents have been successfully removed from the above Azure resources, it is recommended to perform a cleanup of the setup resources. It is important to note that while you may want to delete the setup resources, it is advisable to retain any inventory or process logs for future reference. The cleanup steps have been provided [here](./SetupCleanUp.md) in the documentation.

### **4. What's the cost of running the AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal Utility?**
Estimated average cost for a single run (both discovery and removal phase) of utility on a scope of approx 100K VMs is less than 5$.
It is important to consider that if you choose to retain inventory or process logs, the cost may increase depending on the selected retention period.

### **5. How much time AzTS MMA Discovery and Removal Utility will take to remove MMA agents?**
Estimated average time required for a single run (both discovery and removal phase) of utility on a scope of approx. 100K VMs is around 30 Mins.

### **6. How can I get list of all the Azure Virtual Machines, Virtual Machine scale sets and Azure Arc servers available in configured scope(s)?**
Resources inventory (Virtual Machines, Virtual Machine scale sets and Azure Arc servers) is collected in Log Analytics workspace. To list all resources discovered by utility, go to Log Analytics workspace created during setup --> Select Logs and run following query: 

``` KQL
Inventory_CL
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated,*) by ResourceId = tolower(ResourceId)
| extend OSType = tostring(parse_json(Metadata_s).OSType)
```

### **7. How can I get list of all the VM(s), VMSS(s) and Azure Arc Servers which have both MMA & AMA agent present and are eligible for removal phase?**
Azure resources and Extensions inventory is collected in Log Analytics workspace. To list all the resources which have both MMA & AMA agent present, go to Log Analytics workspace created during setup --> Select Logs and run following query:

| project ResourceId, ProcessingStatus_s, ProcessErrorDetails_s
```


### **11. If I have less number of VMs how can I speed up the process for MMA removal?**
Follow below steps to speed up the process for MMA removal :

Step-1.	Run Update-AzTSMMARemovalUtilityDiscoveryTrigger command with â€“ StartScopeResolverImmediatley switch.

   ``` PowerShell
    Update-AzTSMMARemovalUtilityDiscoveryTrigger ` 
        -SubscriptionId <HostingSubId> `
        -ResourceGroupName <HostingRGName> `
        -StartScopeResolverImmediatley 
   ```

Step-2. Once Virtual Machine inventory is available in dashboard, run Update-AzTSMMARemovalUtilityDiscoveryTrigger command with â€“StartExtensionDiscoveryImmediatley  switch.

   ``` PowerShell
    Update-AzTSMMARemovalUtilityDiscoveryTrigger ` 
        -SubscriptionId <HostingSubId> `
        -ResourceGroupName <HostingRGName> `
        -StartExtensionDiscoveryImmediatley 
   ```

Step-3. One the Extension inventory is available in dashboard, run Update-AzTSMMARemovalUtilityRemovalTrigger command with â€“ StartImmediately switch.

   ``` PowerShell
    Update-AzTSMMARemovalUtilityDiscoveryTrigger ` 
        -SubscriptionId <HostingSubId> `
        -ResourceGroupName <HostingRGName> `
        -StartImmediately
   ```
