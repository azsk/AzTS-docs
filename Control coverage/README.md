## Externally Scanned controls in Azure Tenant Security (AzTS)

There are certain controls that cannot be effectively evaluated by AzTS (due to various limitations for e.g. some controls requires VM instances to be in running state) for such controls AzTS will put verification result as 'ExtScanned'. And effective verification result of such controls should be determined based on external feeds later (if available). 

As verification result for such controls depends on other sources and get determined outside AzTS boundary. So, in AzTS UI, controls with verification result 'ExtScanned' are excluded from compliance. By default, such controls will not be listed in scan results view however user can use filter ('AzTS-based controls only') provided in AzTS UI to list these controls.

### List of externally scanned controls

Following controls in AzTS are currently externally scanned:

| ControlId | DisplayName | Description |

| Azure_VirtualMachine_SI_Enable_Monitoring_Agent | All VMs must have Monitoring Agent enabled | All VMs must have Monitoring Agent enabled |

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<br>

**Even after remediating my resource, it is still showing as failed against controls in AzTS UI. The controls depends on MDC Assessment. What should I do?**

**NOTE:** *Kindly make sure that the resource(s) is(are) already fixed. The controls which depends on MDC assessment could be found [here](#list-of-controls-that-depends-on-microsoft-defender-for-cloud-mdc-in-azure-tenant-security-azts).* 

If a control depends on MDC assessment(s), validate if resource is in healthy state as per MDC recommendation(s), to validate please follow below mentioned steps:

1. Go to **Azure Portal**.
2. Search for **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** and **open** that.

3. Click on **Recommendation under the General tab**, in the left side panel.

    ![Image](../Images/MDCEvaluationImage2.png)

4. Click on the **All Recommendations**.
5. Search for the related [recommendations](#list-of-controls-that-depends-on-microsoft-defender-for-cloud-mdc-in-azure-tenant-security-azts) and open it.

6. Check the list of **unhealthy resources** to see if your resource is present in that list or not.
7. If your resource(s) is not present in unhealthy resources list, run the scan from AzTS UI and check the status of your resource(s).
8. If your resource(s) is present in **unhealthy resources list** and **'Fix' button is available** in the bottom, select the resource(s) that you need to remediate and click on 'Fix' button and wait till your resource(s) show up in **healthy resources list**.

9. If your resource(s) is present in **unhealthy resources list** and **'Fix' button is not available** in the bottom, you have to wait till the MDC evaluation is refreshed and wait till your resource(s) show up in **healthy resources list**. You can find the **refresh interval** at the top.

10. Once your resource(s) appear under healthy resources list, run the scan from AzTS UI to check the status of your resource(s).
