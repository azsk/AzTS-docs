## 210915 (AzTS)

### Feature updates

* Control & Remediation Scripts Development:
    * Bulk Remediation Scripts:
    The bulk remediation scripts for controls mentioned below have been released & can be accessed from the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/azsk/AzTS-docs/tree/main/Scripts/RemediationScripts).
        1. Azure_CloudService_SI_Disable_RemoteDesktop_Access
        2. Azure_Subscription_AuthZ_Remove_Management_Certs
        3. Azure_AppService_DP_Dont_Allow_HTTP_Access

        **Note:** Currently we have focused on auto remediations that are relatively less risky to remediate & do not lead to any  application downtime like scenarios. 

    * Security Verification Tests (SVTs):
    10 Non-Baseline controls have been added to Azure Tenant Scanner. Non baseline controls are those controls that have been implemented in AzTS as a part of effort to migrate all feasible controls from DevOps Kit (AzSK). These include 6 new controls to cover the *TLS 1.2 check for a) API Management b) App Service c) Storage d) DB for MySQL e) DB for PostgreSQL f) SQL Managed Instance
        1. Azure_APIManagement_DP_Use_Secure_TLS_Version
        2. Azure_AppService_DP_Use_Secure_TLS_Version
        3. Azure_DBforMySQL_DP_Use_Secure_TLS_Version
        4. Azure_DBforPostgreSQL_DP_Use_Secure_TLS_Version
        5. Azure_Storage_DP_Use_Secure_TLS_Version
        6. Azure_SQLManagedInstance_DP_Use_Secure_TLS_Version
        7. Azure_KubernetesService_Audit_Enable_Diagnostics_Log
        8. Azure_APIManagement_Audit_Enable_Diagnostics_Log
        9. Azure_DBforMySQL_Audit_Enable_Diagnostics_Log
        10. Azure_DBforPostgreSQL_Audit_Enable_Diagnostics_Log
        
        **Note:** *TLS provides privacy and data integrity between client and server. Using TLS 1.2 version significantly reduces risks from security design issues and security bugs that may be present in older versions.
