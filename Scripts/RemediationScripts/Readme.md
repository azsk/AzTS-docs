## Load remediation script to fix failed controls of Azure Tenant Security Solution - Step by Step
In this section, we will walk through the steps of loading remediation script.

**Note:** You can download remediation script present [here](../../TemplateFiles/RemediationScripts.zip?raw=1)

Loading script in PowerShell session is divided into four steps:

### **Step 1 of 4. Validate prerequisites on machine**  

  i) Installation steps are supported using following OS options: 	

  - Windows 10
  - Windows Server 2019

  ii) PowerShell 5.0 or higher:

  All setup steps will be performed with the help of PowerShell ISE console. If you are unaware of PowerShell ISE, refer [link](https://github.com/azsk/DevOpsKit-docs/blob/master/00b-Getting-Started/GettingStarted_PowerShellTipsAzSK.md) to get basic understanding.
  Ensure that you are using Windows OS and have PowerShell version 5.0 or higher by typing **$PSVersionTable** in the PowerShell ISE console window and looking at the PSVersion in the output as shown below.)
  If the PSVersion is older than 5.0, update PowerShell from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54616).
