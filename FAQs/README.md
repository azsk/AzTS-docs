## FAQs 
- ### **Setup**

 ### **1. Getting error : Class keyword is not allowed in ConstrainedLanguage mode** 
This error can be observed where PowerShell is running in ConstrainedLanguage mode. If local settings for LaguageMode cannot be modified for some reason, AzTS setup can be done using aletrnate options. One of the option is copying deployment files to Azure storage and running the whole deployment procedure within Cloud Shell. 

### **2. How to add new subscriptions or management groups after deploying AzTS**
You just need to provide reader access to scanner Managed Identity at subscription or Management Group level. From next schedule, AzTS will pick up new subscriptions for scanning. 

### **3. On running the AzTS installation command (`Install-AzSKTenantSecuritySolution`) I am getting an error message *"Tenant ID, application ID, principal ID, and scope are not allowed to be updated."***

This is probably happening because the user-assigned managed identity (internal MI) has been deleted from Azure Portal, but the role assignment of this MI is still present at the resource group scope in which the AzTS setup has been installed. The role assignment of a deleted identity looks like below,

![FAQ_GhostIdentity](../Images/12_TSS_FAQ_RBACGhostAccount.png)

To remove role assignment, go to resource group where AzTS solution has been installed --> Access control (IAM) --> Role assignments --> Look for deleted identity (as shown in the screenshot) --> Select the identity and click on 'Remove'.

After deleting the identity, you can run the installation command again.

### **4. While installing AzTS solution I have provided my preferences for telemetry collection i.e. anonymous AzTS usage data and organization/team contact details. How do I update my preferences now?**

To update the telemetry preferences, go to resource group where AzTS solution has been installed --> AzSK-AzTS-AutoUpdater-XXXXX --> Configuration --> Change the values of below listed configurations:

- AIConfigurations\_\_AnonymousUsageTelemetry\_\_LogLevel

  - All --> To opt in for both, Anonymized AzTS usage data and Organization/team contact details.
  - Anonymous --> To opt in for only Anonymized AzTS usage data.
  - Onboarding --> To opt in for only Organization/team contact details.
  - None --> To opt out of both, Anonymized AzTS usage data and Organization/team contact details.

- OnboardingDetails\_\_Organization

  - If AIConfigurations\_\_AnonymousUsageTelemetry\_\_LogLevel is either 'All' or 'Onboarding', then specify the name of your organization in this.
  - If AIConfigurations\_\_AnonymousUsageTelemetry\_\_LogLevel is either 'Anonymous' or 'None', then specify 'N/A' in this.

- OnboardingDetails\_\_Division

  - If AIConfigurations\_\_AnonymousUsageTelemetry\_\_LogLevel is either 'All' or 'Onboarding', then specify the name of your division(division within your organization) in this.
  - If AIConfigurations\_\_AnonymousUsageTelemetry\_\_LogLevel is either 'Anonymous' or 'None', then specify 'N/A' in this.

- OnboardingDetails\_\_ContactEmailAddressList

  - If AIConfigurations\_\_AnonymousUsageTelemetry\_\_LogLevel is either 'All' or 'Onboarding', then specify the team's contact DL in this.
  - If AIConfigurations\_\_AnonymousUsageTelemetry\_\_LogLevel is either 'Anonymous' or 'None', then specify 'N/A' in this.

- ### **Scan**

### **1. Today's AzTS scan has completed. How do I re-run the full scan?**

You can use the on-demand scan command provided [here](../01-Setup%20and%20getting%20started/README.md/) with `-ForceFetch` flag.

### **2. How to disable AzTS scan and uninstall the setup?**
AzTS scans can be disabled by revoking reader access granted to scanner Managed Identity at individual subscription level.
To uninstall or rollback AzTS scaner setup, below steps can be performed:
  1. Revoke scanner MI reader permissions for subscription(s) 
  2. Delete Azure AD application for UI and WebAPI (if created during installtion)
  3. Delete AzTS resource group. 
</br>

### **3. The subscription scan in AzTS is getting terminated due to function timeout. How can I fix it? OR How can I upgrade the pricing tier of AzTS function apps?**

AzTS installation command (`Install-AzSKTenantSecuritySolution`) creates three function apps which are as follows:
1. AzSK-AzTS-MetadataAggregator-xxxxx
2. AzSK-AzTS-WorkItemProcessor-xxxxx
3. AzSK-AzTS-AutoUpdater-xxxxx

These function apps share a common Consumption hosting plan. Azure Functions in a Consumption plan are limited to 10 minutes for a single execution. As a result, subscription scan which take longer than 10 minutes will get terminated. Read more about the hosting plans [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale).

In this case, we recommend you to upgrade the Function app hosting plan (pricing tier) which will give you the flexibility to increase the function timeout value. Following steps will guide you on how to upgrade pricing tier and change function timeout value for AzTS setup.
    
1. To update pricing tier, run `Update-AzFunctionAppPlan` cmdlet as shown below. You can read more about pricing details of function app [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/functions/).

    ```PowerShell
      # 1. Clear existing login, if any

      Disconnect-AzAccount

      # 2. Connect to AzureAD and AzAccount
      # Note: Tenant Id *must* be specified when connecting to Azure AD and AzAccount

      $TenantId = "<TenantId>"
      Connect-AzAccount -Tenant $TenantId

      # 3. Install module, if not already installed
      # Az.Functions >= 4.8.0

      Install-Module -Name Az.Functions -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser -repository PSGallery

      # 4. Import module

      Import-Module -Name Az.Functions

      # 5. Update app service pricing tier

      # AppServicePlanName: Your Function App Service plan (in the Azure portal, go to the AzTS Host RG > select one of function apps, say 'AzSK-AzTS-WorkItemProcessor-xxxxx' > Under the Overview section, copy name of the 'App Service Plan'.)
      # In this example, we are updating service plan to EP2.

      Update-AzFunctionAppPlan -ResourceGroupName <AzTSScanHostRG> `
                                 -Name <AppServicePlanName> `
                                 -Sku EP2

    ```

4. To increase function timeout, go to your function app (say, you want to increase timeout value for 'AzSK-AzTS-WorkItemProcessor-xxxxx'. This app contains function to scan subscription with baseline control.) > Settings > Configuration > Application settings > Update the value of `AzureFunctionsJobHost__functionTimeout` to '01:00:00' to increase the timeout value to 1 hour.

  > _**Note:** In future if you run the AzTS installation command (`Install-AzSKTenantSecuritySolution`) to upgrade your existing AzTS setup, you will have to repeat the above steps._

- ### **Monitoring**

### **1. I am getting alert mail "AzTS MONITORING ALERT: AzTS Auto-Updater Failure Alert". What does it mean? How to stop/resolve this alert?** 
Auto updater runs daily and check for any updates available or not, if there are no updates it will not raise any alert or error. Alert mail "AzTS MONITORING ALERT: AzTS Auto-Updater Failure Alert" mostly indicates Auto updater function is not able to complete its job successfully in past runs.

To get more details about reason behind Autoupdate failure:
1.	Please check  if there any exceptions logged in Application Insight (AzSK-AzTS-AppInsights-xxxxx) by running following query:
exceptions
| where timestamp > ago(3d)
| where operation_Name =~ "AutoUpdater"
| order by timestamp desc
 
2.	If there are no exceptions, then please check  traces of the Job in Application Insight (AzSK-AzTS-AppInsights-xxxxx) by running following query:
traces
| where timestamp > ago(3d)
| where operation_Name =~ "AutoUpdater"
| order by timestamp desc
| project timestamp, message, severityLevel

If you see traces "Exception occurred in UpdateFunctionApp function while updating [AzSK-AzTS-UI-xxxxx]. Exception : [System.Exception: App service [AzSK-AzTS-UI-xxxxx] request to swap slot with production failed", then Auto-Updater is failing as staging and production slot swapping is failing for AzTS UI.You can disable the slot swap feature in Auto Updater with below steps:
1. Go to Auto Updater Function App (AzSK-AzTS-AutoUpdater-xxxxx)
2. Configurations -> Application Settings 
3. Click on add new Application Settings 
4. And setting with following Name and Value,
Name: HostEnvironmentDetails__AutoUpdateConfig__3__DeploymentSlotId
Value: production
5. Select â€˜Deployment Slot Settingâ€™ and save.
 
 
The above steps should stop this recurring alert, please validate after 24 hours using the same queries.

- ### **Control Remediation**

### **1. I want to turn OFF public access on key vault, but it is consumed by Azure Function Apps using consumption plan, How do I add the IP Addresses which are dynamically changing?** 
To remediate the control [Azure_KeyVault_NetSec_Disable_Public_Network_Access](https://github.com/azsk/AzTS-docs/blob/users/vinala/keyvaultiprangescript/Control%20coverage/Feature/KeyVault.md#azure_keyvault_netsec_disable_public_network_access), You need to [configure network settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/how-to-azure-key-vault-network-security?tabs=azure-portal) on key vault to allow access only from selected virtual networks and IP Addresses. However, If the key vault is being consumed from Azure Function Apps which is deployed using Consumption plan, the IP Addresses are bound to dynamically change. One way to allow access to Azure Functions Apps (Consumption Plan) is to whitelist all the Azure IP Addresses pertaining to 'App Service' service tag and the corresponding function app deployed region. 

Azure publishes the information [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56519) every week. Per their installation instruction mentioned in the download center, New ranges appearing in the file will not be used in Azure for at least one week. Hence, users have atmost one week to update the IP ranges to have uninterrupted access to the key vault from the function apps. 

You can use the below PowerShell command let to whitelist the Azure IP ranges for a particular region on key vault. 

``` Powershell
function WhitelistAzureFunctionAppIPRangesOnKeyVault {

param (
$SubscriptionId,
$ResourceGroup,
$KeyVaultResourceId,
$FunctionAppUsageRegion,
$RemoveExistingIPRanges = $false
)

# Connect to the Azure account where the key vault is deployed.
Connect-AzAccount -Subscription $SubscriptionId
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId

# Installing MSIdentityTools Module
Write-Host "Installing MSIdentityTools Module to fetch the Azure published IP ranges..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
Install-Module -Name MSIdentityTools -Scope CurrentUser -Force
# Download the IPRanges from Azure published location and filter the IP ranges for the specific region where the function apps are deployed.
Write-Host "Downloading the Azure published IP ranges..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
Get-MsIdAzureIpRange -ServiceTag AppService -Region $FunctionAppUsageRegion
Write-Host "Successfully downloaded the Azure published IP ranges..." -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "Filtering the IP ranges for IPv4 addresses" -ForegroundColor Yellow
$FilteredIPRanges = ($IPRanges | Where-Object {$_.Contains("::") -eq $false })

# Remove existing IP Ranges if flag is set.
if($RemoveExistingIPRanges -eq $true)
{
Write-Host "Overridding the IP Address ranges with the Azure IP ranges for specified function app region:" $FunctionAppUsageRegion -ForegroundColor Yellow
Update-AzKeyVaultNetworkRuleSet -ResourceId $KeyVaultResourceId -IpAddressRange $FilteredIPRanges -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId
Write-Host "Successfully overridden the IP Address ranges with the Azure IP ranges for specified function app region:" $FunctionAppUsageRegion -ForegroundColor Green

}
else
{
Write-Host "Appending the IP Address ranges with the Azure IP ranges for specified function app region:" $FunctionAppUsageRegion -ForegroundColor Yellow
Add-AzKeyVaultNetworkRule -ResourceId $KeyVaultResourceId -IpAddressRange $FilteredIPRanges -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId
Write-Host "Successfully appended the IP Address ranges with the Azure IP ranges for specified function app region:" $FunctionAppUsageRegion -ForegroundColor Green

}

}
```

The same can be integrated into your DevOps pipeline using the YAML below to run it every 3 days on a scheduled basis to have the latest IP ranges updated on the allowed IP Addresses for key vault.
